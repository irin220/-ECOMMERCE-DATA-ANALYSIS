## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze the ecommerce order data using SQL queries and visualize the results. By examining customer information, product details, order history, and payment data, we aim to gain actionable insights that can assist in making informed business decisions.

## Data

The project utilizes three main tables in the database:

- `customer`: Contains customer details.
- `product`: Holds information about available products.
- `order_details`: Captures data related to customer orders.

## Data Analysis

The project covers a wide range of analyses, including:

- Customer Analysis
- Product Analysis
- Order Analysis
- Sales Analysis
- Customer Order Patterns
- Time-based Analysis
- Geographical Analysis
- Product Performance
- Customer Retention
- Payment Analysis
- Additional Analyses (e.g., quantity-wise and year-wise top customers, impact of discounts, stock levels, payment mode correlation)

## Visualizations

Visualizations have been created for each analysis, showcasing bar plots, pie charts, line plots, and more. The visualizations aid in presenting the insights derived from the data analysis in a clear and understandable manner.

## Key Findings

The key findings of the analysis include:

- City-wise customer distribution
- Top-selling products and slow-moving products
- Order status distribution
- Revenue generated from orders
- Customer retention rates
- Time-based trends in sales
- Geographical preferences in product choices

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `SQL_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing SQL queries, data analysis, and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `data/`: Folder containing the database schema and sample data.
- `images/`: Folder storing visualizations generated by the analysis.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis or contribute to the project, follow the steps outlined in the Jupyter Notebook. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests to improve the analysis, add new visualizations, or address any identified issues.
