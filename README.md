# Ecommerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project conducts a thorough data analysis of ecommerce order data for a fictional company. Leveraging SQL queries and visualizations, we aim to gain valuable insights into customer behavior, product performance, order patterns, and other critical aspects that can inform strategic business decisions.

## Objective

This project aims to provide actionable insights into ecommerce operations by analyzing customer information, product details, order history, and payment data. The findings can guide informed decision-making for business growth and customer satisfaction.

## Data

The project utilizes three main tables in the database:

- `customer`: Contains customer details.
- `product`: Holds information about available products.
- `order_details`: Captures data related to customer orders.

## Data Analysis

The project covers a wide range of analyses, including:

- Customer Analysis
- Product Analysis
- Order Analysis
- Sales Analysis
- Customer Order Patterns
- Time-based Analysis
- Geographical Analysis
- Product Performance
- Customer Retention
- Payment Analysis
- Additional Analyses (e.g., quantity-wise and year-wise top customers, impact of discounts, stock levels, payment mode correlation)

## Visualizations

Visualizations have been created for each analysis, showcasing bar plots, pie charts, line plots, and more. The visualizations aid in presenting the insights derived from the data analysis in a clear and understandable manner.

## Key Findings

The key findings of the analysis include:

- City-wise customer distribution
- Top-selling products and slow-moving products
- Order status distribution
- Revenue generated from orders
- Customer retention rates
- Time-based trends in sales
- Geographical preferences in product choices

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `SQL_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing SQL queries, data analysis, and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `data/`: Folder containing the database schema and sample data.
- `images/`: Folder storing visualizations generated by the analysis.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis or contribute to the project, follow the steps outlined in the Jupyter Notebook. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests to improve the analysis, add new visualizations, or address any identified issues.
